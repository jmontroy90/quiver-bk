Fields for structured logging?\n\nLoggers like Apex allow us to include Fields on our logger as state to be included in all subsequent calls. This is a bit of mutability that can be tricky to manage.\n\n## Handlers\nLogs need middleware too. A simple `Handler` interface (like what Apex/log does) can help you register these handlers, which can manage text, sockets, JSON, \"discard\", etc.\n\n## Structured Logging\nStructured logging is best because we can index and query on structured KV fields. It's like querying a database of logs, more machine-friendly for things like Splunk."
