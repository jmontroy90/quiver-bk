The current implementation for Broadcasts is the **TorrentBroadcast**, which is modelled after P2P networking. First check local for shuffle blocks, then check JVMs on the same node, then rack neighbors.\n    * Configuration of this is managed via: `spark.broadcast.blockSize`, `spark.broadcast.checksum`, `spark.broadcast.compress`."
