Codecs translate raw bytes into something HTTP/2 can understand.\n\n### External Authorization\ne.g. **ext-authz**\nIf the external authorization cluster deems something unauthorized:\n* Network (L3/L4) ext-authz will simply close the connection\n* HTTP ext-authz will return a _403 Forbidden_\n\nIf the external cluster is down, we need to ensure that \"failure_mode_allow\" isn't set to true -- we don't want an outage to open the floodgates."
