This is fun, two-way sync stuff.\n\n### Code Quality\n* We have a lot of conditionals floating around that are frequently forgotten when adding / changing code. We should make use of better design patterns to centralize these kinds of common / enclosing behavior.\n\n### Concerns\n* All errors are logged, not handled. We need proper alerting to ensure we don't silently miss failed deletes.\n  * Example: all CRUD operators in `concord_sync.go`\n* No operations are atomic. This could lead to partial failures and incomplete state.\n  * Example: `concord_sync.go:syncClusters():154-155`"
