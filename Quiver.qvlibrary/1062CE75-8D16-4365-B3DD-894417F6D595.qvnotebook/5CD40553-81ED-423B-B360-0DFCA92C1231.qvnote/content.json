The \n\nDifferent policies have different ACLs for various secrets, whitelisted by path in Vault. This config is set up in HCL, a config language specific to HashiCorp.\n\nAuthenticate using the Vault CLI with your AD creds and it will generate a token for you there. The new Vault UI doesn't give you a token like Goldfish did.\n\nThe \"vault\" stanza in the service manifest defines a list of Vault policies to use. Nomad reaches out to Vault and generates a token with the corresponding policy permissions on it. It then grabs your `vault_vars` with that token and embeds them into your service's environment.\n\n**Vault Architecture**\n\n3 - 5 nodes per region / environment\nOne leader per region, leader electino process is same as Nomad's\nVault's storage back-end is Consul!\nWhen Vault is restarted, it loads up **sealed**, where no operations for anyone can occur. Must `unseal` before working with it normally."
