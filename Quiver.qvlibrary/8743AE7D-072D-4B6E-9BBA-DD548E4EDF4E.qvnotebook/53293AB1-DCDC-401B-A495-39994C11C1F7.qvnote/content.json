Work with control flow.\n2) Object-oriented programming — we don't need everything to be local to stack frames. Why not have objects on the heap that outlive the return of a function and its associated stack frame? Functions are now objects, local vars are instance variables.\n3) Functional programming — don't use assignment, but be immutable!\n\nAll these **take away** some patterns from programmers. This is fine."
