Any good monitoring and alerting system must have high signal and low noise.\n* Avoid complex dependency hierarchies, e.g. \"if X happens, alert on this and scale this, but only if Y is also high\". Systems change, bugs are introduced with complexity. Keep your threshold- / causality-based monitoring rules as simple as possible, or as long-term as possible so that extreme outliers won't make your system go crazy."
