Let the filesystem help you!\n\nThe following Cassandra components are stored in memory:\n\n* Bloom filters\n* Partition summary\n* Partition key cache\n* Compression offsets\n* SSTable index summary\n* Memtables\n* Gathered replicas for read / anti-entropy repair\n\nOff-heap memory is also used as such:\n* Page cache\n* The Bloom filter and compression offset maps reside off-heap.\n* Cached rows in native memory, outside the Java heap"
