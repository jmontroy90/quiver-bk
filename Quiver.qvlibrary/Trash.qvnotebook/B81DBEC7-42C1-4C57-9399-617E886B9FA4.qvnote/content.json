Check Concord, Marquis, and the endpoint Cluster itself for health before admitting a ClusterNode resource -- we should admit them if tardiness is due to slow Azure autoscaling on an IP.\n\n\n\n* (10/1/2019) Secrets are pulled in from Concord on startup, and then are constantly reconciled (e.g. checked for existence, recreated as needed) with Concord on each `Reconcile` of a `Cluster`. This is fun, two-way sync stuff.\n\n"
