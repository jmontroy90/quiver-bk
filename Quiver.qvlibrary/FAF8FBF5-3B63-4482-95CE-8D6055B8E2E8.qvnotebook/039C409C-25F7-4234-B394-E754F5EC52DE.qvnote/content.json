Are all potentially impacted parties able to access this incident management? Are they being emailed? Slacked?\n\nRollback procedures are just important as the actual code changes. It's not an afterthought.\n\n\"Out-of-band communication\" -- how do you communicate and coordinate on an outage if your communication software is ALSO adversely impacted? Who gets a page if PagerDuty is down? Set up your systems and networks to minimize the blast radius of your changes!\n\nThis chapter wasn't very interesting."
