How to define cluster health?\n\nThey have a ConfigMap trigger that either rotates (new images, max surge, etc.) or freezes updates on nodes. \n\nAll workloads on a node are drained, moved to the new updated node, and then the old node is deleted by a cloud provider call.\n\nIs there downtime built into this? Are you guaranteed that the drained workloads only land on the new updated node? What happens if node A upgrades successfully, and node B doesn't? Why do this all as a ConfigMap, instead of a CRD?"
