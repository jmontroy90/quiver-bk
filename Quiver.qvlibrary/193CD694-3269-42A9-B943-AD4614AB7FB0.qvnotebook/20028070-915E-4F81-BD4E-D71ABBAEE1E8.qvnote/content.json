Dur, but easy to forget.\n`kubectx` can create aliases itself with `kubectx short=long-name-sucks`\n\n## Sharing GPUs Across Containers\nFor GPUs: no cgroups, no virtual memory addressable like CPUs, time-sliced allocation.\nKubernetes is good at extending its schedulers and placement, but sharing devices on the backend is still hard, e.g. guarantees usually provided by cgroups.\n\n## OPA for CRD Validation\nOpenAPI V3 schemas provide basics, but wildcard / dynamic data gets tough. Plus existence checks are tough!\n\n## Instrument Operators\n`kube-state-metrics` is a library that allows you to instrument CRDs / Operators in a simple way to expose standard Prometheus metrics. There's standard metric exporting too, for existing operators."
